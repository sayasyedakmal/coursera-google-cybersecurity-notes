### Introduction to cybersecurity

#### Common cybersecurity terminology
    
    Cybersecurity = security - ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people and data from unauthorized access or criminal explotation.
    
    Security analyst or cybersecurity analyst
    - monitor networks for breaches
    - helps develop strategies to secure an organization
    - research information technology(IT) security trends to remain alert and informed about potential threats.
    - prevent incidents

##### Key concepts:
   
    - **Compliance** - process of adherin to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
    - **Security frameworks** - guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
    - **Security controls** - safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
    - **Security posture** - organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
    - **threat actor** - malicious attacker - any person or group who presents a security risk. THis risk can relate to computers, applications, networks and data.
    - **internal threat** - current or former employee, an external vendor or a trusted partner who pose a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
    - **Network security** - practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization's network.
    - **Cloud security** - process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network mmade up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
    - **Programming** - process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks:
        - Automation of repetitive tasks - i.e searching a list of malicious domains
        - Reviewing web traffic
        - Alerting suspicous activity
    
### Core skills for cybersecurity professionals

#### Transferable and technical cybersecurity skills

    Transferable skills = skills from other areas of study or practice that can be apply to different careers.
    Technical skills = may apply to sveral professions - require knowledge of specific tools, procedures and policies.

##### Transferable skills

    - **Communication** - As a cybersecuriy analyst, you will need to communicate and collaborate with others. Understanding others' questions or concerns and communicating information clearly to individuals with technical and non-technical knowledge will help you mitigate security issues quickly.

    - **Problem-solving** - One of your main tasks as a cybersecurity analyst will be to proactively identify and solve problems. You can do this by recognizing attack patterns, then determining the most efficient solution to minimize risk. Don't be affraid to take risks, and try new things. Also, understand that it's rare to find a perfect solution to a problem. You'll likely need to compromise.

    - **Time management** - Having a heigtened sense of urgency and priotizing tasks appropriately is essential in the cybersecurity field. So, effective time management will help you minimize potential damage and risk to critical assets and data. Additionally, it will be important to priotize tasks and stay focused on the most urgent issue.

    - **Growth mindset** - This is an evolving industry, so an important transferable skills is a willingness to learn. Technology moves fast, and that's a great thing! It doesn't mean you will need to learn it all but it does mean that you'll need to continue to learn throughout your career. Fortunately, you wll be able to apply much of what you learn in this program to your ongoing professional development.

    - **Diverse persectives** - The only way to go far is together. y having respect for each other and encouraging diverse perspectives and mutual respect, you'll undoubtedly find multiple and better solutions to securiry problems.

##### Tehnical skills

    - **Programming languages** - By understanding how to use programming languages, cybersecurity analyts can automate tasks that would otherwise be very time consuming. Examples of tasks that programming can be used for include searching data to identify potential threats or organizing and analyzing information to identify patterns related to security issues.

    - **Security information and event management (SIEM) tools** - SIEM tools collect and analyze log data, or records of events such as unusual login behavior, and support analysts' ability to monitor critical activities in and organization. This helps cybersecurity professionals identify and analyze potential security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities more efficiently.
