### Introduction to cybersecurity

#### Common cybersecurity terminology
    
    Cybersecurity = security - ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people and data from unauthorized access or criminal explotation.
    
    Security analyst or cybersecurity analyst
    - monitor networks for breaches
    - helps develop strategies to secure an organization
    - research information technology(IT) security trends to remain alert and informed about potential threats.
    - prevent incidents

##### Key concepts:
   
    - **Compliance** - process of adherin to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
    - **Security frameworks** - guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
    - **Security controls** - safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
    - **Security posture** - organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
    - **threat actor** - malicious attacker - any person or group who presents a security risk. THis risk can relate to computers, applications, networks and data.
    - **internal threat** - current or former employee, an external vendor or a trusted partner who pose a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
    - **Network security** - practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization's network.
    - **Cloud security** - process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network mmade up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
    - **Programming** - process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks:
        - Automation of repetitive tasks - i.e searching a list of malicious domains
        - Reviewing web traffic
        - Alerting suspicous activity
